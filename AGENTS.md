# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **journeylab** (11283 symbols, 17219 relationships, 77 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## vexp - Context-Aware AI Coding <!-- vexp v3.1.3 -->

### Context strategy: call run_pipeline ONCE at task start
If the task already names the files/symbols to touch, SKIP vexp. Otherwise one
`run_pipeline({ "task": "..." })` returns ranked pivot files with line ranges and
blast radius. Do NOT open files one by one to find your way around - every extra
tool call costs a turn. Call it again ONLY when the task moves to a new area.
`get_skeleton` for files to understand, not edit. `verify_done` before calling a
multi-file task complete, then RUN the tests it names.

### Query shape (do this)
Anchor the task on real identifiers (ClassName, functionName) or file paths:
`run_pipeline({ "task": "fix JWT expiry in AuthService.validateToken" })`

vexp runs entirely on this machine, index in `.vexp/`;
`run_pipeline` transmits nothing to any external service.
On `status: "degraded"` or 0 pivots the index is still building - use your own tools.
For literal string sweeps use your native search - do NOT route text sweeps through vexp.
Repo SOURCE only: logs, dist/, node_modules/ and files outside the repo are NOT indexed.
